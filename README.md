# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project

This repository contains code and analysis for a machine learning project focused on breast cancer diagnosis. The goal of this project is to predict whether breast tumors are malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features.
## Project Overview

Breast cancer is a critical health concern affecting many individuals. This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using a dataset of tumor features. The primary tasks include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle and contains information about various tumor features. It's divided into features that describe the characteristics of the tumor and a target column that indicates whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).
